we need columns in GUI properly mapped
different Model types need to collapse and translate inserts/updates accordingly
update should take two parameters


partitioning strategy returns -1 for drop, 1-n for accept
listeners register at known index
partitioner goes back to model behind it when listener registers... - how ?


I think that we need :

ListModel/View - a simple queue of replayable deltas
MapModel/View - collapses deltas according to a pluggable strategy - initially a combination of id/version

ListView interface would probably support upsert/delete
MapView interface would probably support insert/update/delete

By increasing granularity of MapView interface we can better support
aggregators (as Model/Views) that need to e.g. total trades by various criteria, but do
not need to hold them all.

A projection can then be expressed as the set of aggregations of trade
amounts for a given set of days, along with a set of balances, an
active balance and a total.

We also need to introduce/extend a datatype to encapsulate :

key/version/serialisable

MapModel/View should use this, whereas LiistModel may just use Object/?

Should we split version out of Datum ?

What if we want to batch together a number of insertions, updates and deletions ?

demo views/apps: cash sheet / traffic lights
Logical and actual COB / EOD


aggregate by partition

aggregate by amount
aggregate by rolling up with initial balance : account projection for given period set
aggregate by amount : total due for a/c on given period
filter by account : trades for a/c on given period
filter by period : trades for given period
trade

list of trades and totals should be different models - since I may want to just listen to the latter

nostro and currency projections should be separate models/event for same reason

should each model be capable of aggregating, e.g. a Total for its trades ?

if each model was responsible for totalling itself, a view aggregating all the totals would have to listen to all the data as well as the aggregations....

Aggregators are NOT remotable - they calling must be GUARANTEED, because the are managing DELTAS
Does ordering matter - it shouldn't do - but we need to know whether w are inserting/updating/deleting...
Aggregators should be attached synchronously - otherwise they will need versioning
an aggregator should not be writing onto the wire as receivers of this info may thread inputs and therefore get info in wrrong order
can messages overtake each other on wire - best to assume so.
therefore messages over wire must be versioned
if aggregators are to be unversioned, they must listen and notify synchronously and invm - lets start that way.

an aggregating model must maintain version and key

should we just allow models to support listening to multiple
"attributes" - i.e. "data", "total", "all" - is this better than
multiple models ?


attach a synchronous aggregator to each account's day's trades
feed them into a ProjectionModel which maintains a row for each account with a version
each time a row is updated it recalculates the projection and increments the version
