DADA is essentially a set of components for building a highly
concurrent and distributed graph of interconnected Models and Views.

A typical pattern would comprise a Feed Model viewed by a number Views
the other side of which are more Models viewd by more Views etc...

Updates can be filtered efficiently into specific Views through the
use of another type of View called a Router. Routers support the
thread-safe on-demand creation of Views when relevant data ariive.

Views may be invm with their Model or transparently remoted via a JMS
provider.

DADA is intended to be used in highly scalable applications and can
handle thousands of updates a second.
